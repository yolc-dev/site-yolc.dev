[ANN] Yolc - a safe, expressive, fun language for Ethereum
==========================================================

Today is the launch of the technical preview of the Yolc project. It is the first milestone where Yolc can produce a
partial ERC20 code deployable to Ethereum networks, demonstrating the key idea of linear-type safety.

In summary:

* Yolc is purely functional with linear-type safety and is made for the Ethereum virtual machine.
* Yolc embeds itself in the Haskell language before being compiled into Solidity/Yul code.
* Yolc allows you to write safe code in production, a joyful experience for super coders.

Yolc doesn't rebuild wheels. Yolc integrates with [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), generates
Solidity/Yul code and Yolc is not a language on its own since programming in Yul is programming in Haskell.

Yolc aims to feature-parity with Solidity plus additional advanced type-level features by 2025/Q1. And the prototype of
the core of [Superfluid protocol](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/) v3 will use Yolc at the same
time.

Please find the complete introduction blog post of the Yolc project [here](https://yolc.dev/blog/introduce-yolc/), and
follow its progress through your favorite channels listed at [linktr.ee/yolc](https://linktr.ee/yolc).

I look forward to having you join Yolc's journey!
