30th July 2015, the Ethereum network went live.\nFast-forward 10 years. By the time of writing this post, according to etherscan, the Ethereum\nnetwork has made 2.6 billion transactions and processed 21.6 million blocks. It currently processes 13 transactions per\nsecond on its base layer alone, while a few layer 2s further scale its capacity at a much higher throughput of\ntransactions per second.\n\nEthereum has already significantly impacted the world and is here to stay.\n\nProgramming on Ethereum, as a smart contract platform, has never been easier since the creation of the Solidity\nlanguage. Many have benefited from it, creating worldwide socially and economically\nimpactful experiments and applications simply by having a computer and an internet connection.\nEthereum's success has attracted much brainpower to its ecosystem. Over the years, some have also left and attempted to\nreplicate its success by bringing the best of the current human knowledge through a clean slate start. It is a healthy\nmarket phenomenon of competition. Still, as a citizen of the Ethereum ecosystem, it is also an important signal that\nthere are areas where we can learn and progress further.\nWhat The Yolc!?\nYolc (as opposed to... solc, the solidity compiler) was born in response to one specific area: the Ethereum\necosystem needs a general-purpose programming language that is safe, expressive, and as fun as Solidity to work with.\nGeneral Purpose\nYolc is not entirely a new language. Instead, it embeds itself in Haskell\nlanguage. Therefore, programming in Yolc is programming in Haskell, a general-purpose\nlanguage with its share of success in the industry, including the latest\nones such as Groq.\nAdditionally, Yolc implements both the Ethereum contract ABI\nspecification and a domain model of\nSolidity/Yul entirely inside the Haskell language so that you can\naccess all Haskell language features before the Haskell code gets compiled into the Solidity/Yul code.\nSafe\nHaskell is a purely functional language that provides many type-level safety features when programming. One of the\nsafety features is\n\"LinearTypes,\"\nwhich powers one of the unique features of Yolc: \"linearly versioned data.\"  In short, this makes a class of\nvulnerabilities, such as reentrance issues, impossible to pass the type-checker. It is a direct result of having\nimplicit data versioning when dealing with data retrieved from the \"world,\" whereby \"outdated information\" cannot be\nused in the current state of the \"world.\"\nHere is an example (with some code omission for simplicity) of data versioning:\n\nSwapping step 2 and step3 will produce the correct code.\nIn the next blog posts, a more detailed explanation of linear safety will explain how it actually works and how to use\nit in your advantages.\nExpressive\nWith Yolc, one should write one's core smart contract in pure functions where storage or external contract interactions\nare not involved. Pure functions do not require linear-type safety.\nYolc incentivizes you to write more pure functions because writing linear-type safety code requires some crafting, a\ntrade-off in exchange for higher-level code safety.\nIn contrast, writing pure function code in Yolc is expressive since you can access all Haskell language features,\nincluding pattern matching, generalized algebraic data types, parametrically polymorphic functions, etc. More future\nblog posts will explain these features as more becomes available to Yolc.\nHere is an example of patter matching on optional (Haskell's Maybe type) numbers:\n\nFun\nOnce you have access to more advanced and modern language features, writing code that is more likely to be safe in a\nproduction environment, programming on Ethereum becomes a fun experience.\n\nThus, the Yolc project's core motivation is to balance safety, expressiveness, and fun when programming on\nEthereum.\n\nJoin!\nToday is the launch of the technical preview of the Yolc project. It is the first milestone where Yolc can produce a\npartial ERC20 code deployable to Ethereum\nnetworks, demonstrating the key idea of linear-type safety. The technical preview still has its rough edges, but you can\nalready get started.\nIt has a roadmap to reach key feature parity with Solidity by 2025 Q1, shipping unique features beyond Solidity all the\ntime, and adoption from key projects, such as Superfluid\nProtocol prototyping its core logic of next version using\nYolc.\nI invite you to join the journey of Project Yolc by following the updates and learn about Yolc via your favorite\nchannels listed in linktr.ee/yolc.

Later on, if there is any chance that the state of the virtue\nmachine is updated, then the previously read data must be considered outdated and shall not be used again.\nHere are two inspiring examples to show how this safety feature can prevent bugs\nExample 1: Requiring \"from != to\"\nIn the following example, an innocuous ERC20 transfer function which does routinely:\n\nRetrieve sender and receiver's balances.\nCalculate new balances.\nDo something with the new balances.\nUpdate balances.\n\n\nHowever, there is a deadly mistake: it should check that if \"from != to\".\nIn canonical ERC20 examples, it typically checks the condition. It may seem contrived, but in custom transfer\nimplementations, where such intermediate values may seem an optimization, such a mistake can occur.\nNonetheless, with Yolc, it is a compile-time error:\n\nWith outdated data version, what Yolc says is: \"Since you don't provide a \"run-time witness\" (we will explain this\nconcept in a future article) that 'from' not equal 'to', I have no choice but assume that newReceiverBalance may have\nchanged since then.\" And Yolc throws an error instead.\nMagic! But how can I write the correct code instead?\nYou can always rearrange the code, such that you perform the update after each reading:\n\nIn a more general setting, there are two more solutions:\n\nProvide a run-time witness in a type-safe way that compiler is happy with. We will explain this solution in a future\narticle.\nRe-read the data! This solution is expensive, but always works.\n\nExample 2: Type-Safe \"Checks Effects Interactions\"\nAnother data version-related common bug is re-entrancy attack vulnerability, where the data you are using may be\noutdated due to an non-trusted external call may have altered it. Common Solidity practice such as \"check effects\ninteractions\" provide a good guideline of how to prevent this from happening; open-zeppelin also provides\nreentrance-lock that serves as a hammer to the problem.\nYolc data version provides a type-safe solution to this, instead.\nHere is a mint function:\n\nAnd it has a glaring re-entrancy vulnerability. It certainly didn't follow the \"checks-effects-interactions\"\nguideline. Again, Yolc catches it:\n\nWe get the same outdated data version error!\nUnder The Hood\nData versioning is only the beginning of how Yolc explores more type-level safety guarantees.\nUnder the hood, it is the GHC's\n\"LinearTypes\" feature provides the horse\npower. One usage of linear types allows type-level enforcement of linearly transitioned state, a form of model checking\nclosely related to Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL). We will demonstrate such a claim in the future development Yolc.\nLinear types is also closely related to uniqueness types. Some claims GHC's linearity-on-arrows is more general purpose\nthan uniqueness types. An example of uniqueness type is the borrow-checker in Rust to ensure unique ownership of a\nresource handle enforced in type-level.\nRead here to learn more about how linear types is used in Yolc to internally for not just\ndata versioning.\n","id":"https://yolc.dev/docs/concepts/data-versioning/","title":"Data Versioning"},"https://yolc.dev/docs/concepts/edsl/":{"body":"What Is Deep Embedding\nHaskell is a great host language for writing Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), and Yolc provides a deep-embedded DSL in\nHaskell called \"YulDSL/Haskell.\"\nProgramming in Yolc is programming in Haskell:\n\nThe above is a valid Haskell code, and Yolc's Yul code generator can interpret[^1] and generate the\nfollowing valid Solidity/Yul code:\n\nThe difference between shallow and deep embedding lies in that deep embedding can reinterpret the original programs into\ndifferent forms. In our case, a different interpreter can also translate the same program into a GraphViz diagram.\n\n\n💡 Read here to learn more about the inner category-theoretical working of the \"YulDSL.\"\n\nInteroperability\nYolc will be able to interact with Solidity code, and Yolc will generate Solidity code helpers for Solidity code to\ninteract with Yolc generated code.\nContract ABI Compatible\nFirst of all, Yolc will be fully-compatible with Contract\nABI. You can interact with contracts written by Solidity, and\nvice versa.\n\n⚠️ Some parts of the support is still work-in-progress.\n\nStorage Layout\nTo access contract storage, a similar layout mechanism to Solidity's \"map\" is provided. The following are code for static\nfunctions to balances and allowances in a ERC20 example contract.\n\nNote that you can specify storage location with a string that is hashed by keccak256.\nExpressive Type System\nThanks to the deep embedding, Yolc has access to all the Haskell's type level features. Here are a few notable ones.\nPolymorphic Types, or \"Generics\"\nYou could write a function that works for any integer types. In the following example, the same poly_foo function is\ninstantiated to uint8, int32 and uint256 types.\n\nHigher Kinded Types\nThis allows you to define type that takes a parameter of another type. The following example shows a \"Maybe\" type, or\nsometimes called optional value in some other languages.\n\nAnd if you knew some Haskell already, you may have guessed that &lt;$$&gt; is the operator version of fmap in Yolc.\nAlgebraic Data Type\nWith Yolc, you can define more than just \"struct\" in Solidity. A struct is called a \"product\" type in Algebraic Data\nType (ADT). You should feel free to ignore such a pedantic naming. However, what makes ADT more powerful the dual of the\n\"product\" type, \"sum\" type.\n\nNow you can represent a buy order with two different cases: A market order, or a limit order.\nTo work with it, you can use Yolc's pattern-matching feature:\n\n\n💡 Read here to learn more about how to define and work with ADT in Yolc.\n\nLinearTypes and Data Versioning\nMost notably, Yolc uses LinearTypes to provide a constrained environment to program effectful code (storage access,\nexternal contract messaging, etc.) with data versioning.\nWith data versioning, programming bugs such as \"re-entrance\" errors, or more generally using \"outdated\" data, are\neliminated in compile-times.\nRead here to learn more about Data versioning in Yolc.\n","id":"https://yolc.dev/docs/concepts/edsl/","title":"Embedded DSL (EDSL) in Haskell"},"https://yolc.dev/docs/getting-started/":{"body":"","id":"https://yolc.dev/docs/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started"},"https://yolc.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/":{"body":"Yolc is a safe, expressive, fun language for Ethereum, powered by YulDSL/Haskell.\n\n🚧 Yolc is currently in technical preview: it works for technical demos, but feature-parity with Solidity will come by\n2025/Q2.\n\nTry It Out\nBecause it is still in technical preview, to give the current technical demo a try, you should use\nNix to get a reproducible, declarative, and reliable development environment\nfor settingup Yolc:\n\n\nStep 1: Follow the official instruction for installing Nix the package\nmanager.\n\n\nStep 2: After installing Nix, you may also need to add this to nix.conf (located in .config/nix in single-user\ninstalls and in /etc/nix in multi-user installs):\n\n\n\nStep 3: Checkout the yul-dsl-monorepo where Yolc is built from.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Enter the Development Environment Through Nix Shell\n\n\n\nStep 5: Run the ERC20 demo that test it using foundry.\n\n\n\n\nGreat success!\nYou should now also have a look of how the Solidity/Yul code looks like:\n\n\n  Click here to see the generated Solidity/Yul code\n\n\nThe code that produces this is under\n/examples/demo/src/ERC20.hs.\nGoing Further\nFind the best channel for you on linktr.ee/yolc to follow the updates of the project.

While it is not yet feature parity with Solidity, we have released the technical review and deployed examples to\nEthereum networks. Read the the instruction here to get started.\nYolc will not be a complete toolkit for building Ethereum contracts. Instead, it works best with\nfoundry. More improvements to boilerplate generation will come, so, for\nnow you can see a working example from here.\nThe following milestones (with monthly cadence) will be more than feature parity with Solidity. Yolc is always about\npioneering new possibilities. Follow the project kanban board for more\ndetails.\n⋄ Is Yolc a completely new language?\nNo. Yolc embeds itself in the Haskell language, more specifically, GHC version\n9.10.\nTo do so, Yolc implements both the Ethereum contract ABI\nspecification and a domain model of\nSolidity/Yul entirely inside the Haskell language so that you can\naccess all Haskell language features before the Haskell code gets compiled into the Solidity/Yul code.\n⋄ What was the motivation behind Yolc?\nThe author is behind the Superfluid Protocol on Ethereum\nnetworks, a money protocol that adds richer semantics to otherwise dull payment infrastructures. While looking for\nimprovement opportunities for version 3 of the Superfluid protocol, it became evident to the author that the Ethereum\necosystem needed a safer and more expressive language that is also fun to program on.\nInstead of waiting for such a thing to appear, the author took the matter into his own hands. Meanwhile, remembering the\npaper \"The Next 700 Programming Languages\" by\nP. J. Landin, the author\ncreated Yolc by embedding it in the Haskell language instead of creating an entirely new but single-purposed language.\n⋄ Where to learn more about Yolc?\nIf you haven't yet, read the introduction blog post to get familiar with the key concepts of\nYolc.\nThe next step is to visit the linktr.ee/yolc to follow the updates and get stuck in soon.\n⋄ Does Yolc's logo mean something?\nYes. The Ethereum logo in the center means that Yolc is built for Ethereum. The circling arrows and dots around the logo\nmeans\nisomorphism in\ncategory theory.\nYolc is powered by YulDSL/Haskell, and YulDSL grounds itself on category\ntheory.\n","id":"https://yolc.dev/docs/help/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},"https://yolc.dev/privacy-policy/":{"body":"TLDR: We do not use cookies and we do not collect any personal data.\nWebsite visitors\n\nNo personal information is collected.\nNo information is stored in the browser.\nNo information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties.\nNo information is shared with advertising companies.\nNo information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends.\nNo information is monetized.\n\nContact us\nContact us if you have any questions.\nEffective Date: 1st May 2021\n","id":"https://yolc.dev/privacy-policy/","title":"Privacy Policy"}},"docInfo":{"https://yolc.dev/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/authors/":{"body":3,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/blog/introduce-yolc/":{"body":458,"title":2},"https://yolc.dev/community/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/docs/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/docs/advanced/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://yolc.dev/docs/advanced/category-dsl/":{"body":2,"title":4},"https://yolc.dev/docs/advanced/linear-types/":{"body":2,"title":4},"https://yolc.dev/docs/concepts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/docs/concepts/adt/":{"body":2,"title":4},"https://yolc.dev/docs/concepts/data-versioning/":{"body":316,"title":2},"https://yolc.dev/docs/concepts/edsl/":{"body":293,"title":4},"https://yolc.dev/docs/getting-started/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://yolc.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/":{"body":144,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/docs/help/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://yolc.dev/docs/help/faq/":{"body":212,"title":3},"https://yolc.dev/privacy-policy/":{"body":39,"title":2}},"length":18},"lang":"English"}
